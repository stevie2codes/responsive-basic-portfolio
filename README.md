## What I Learned

I utilized bootstrap for a responsive design. This came with some challenges. 
I learned bootstrap has pre defined classes which you have to manipulate to achieve your desired
result. By the end of the project I had memorized all of the class names for paddings and margins.
But I heavily relied on the Bootstrap Documentation to complete the project.

## What I like about Bootstrap
  The overall pre-designed layout features are great. Being able to have an element placed
  into your page ready to go is a plus. Im sure with time and practice I can become much
  more efficent with manipulating classes and improve my overall understanding of bootstraps 
  use of flexbox and grid system.
  
  ## What I dislike about Bootstrap
    While this framework provides many pre designed elements it is lacking some minor features. 
    Restrictions on border paddings, color limitations, font limitations and much more. 
    In the future using an external style sheet will be an absolute must when utilizing bootstrap.
